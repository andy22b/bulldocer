# bulldocer
Python module, written with the aim of making body-waveform modelling of earthquakes easier.
At present, it contains three parts.

# Unpacking
This is the most developed section. Mt5 Eq reads in data from tar.gz files and writes out a .INV file.

# Synthetics
Hopefully, I will soon be able to calculate synthetic seismograms, and rewrite the GUI of MT5.

# GUI
In progress...
